<h1>Example Compose Multiplatform (Android + iOS) app with everything you need for modern development</h1>
This is an example Compose Multiplatform/Kotlin Multiplatform mobile app that includes all the bits and pieces required for modern development:

- Shared Compose-based UI
- Reactive UI with Kotlin flows as data sources
- Compose-based animated visual transitions between screens
- Centralized UI styling, including custom fonts
- Dependency injection (Koin)
- Network communication (Ktorfit)
- Database storage (SqlDelight)
- Key-value storage for things like user preferences (multiplatform-settings)
- Single source of truth with remote-local data synchronisation (Store5)
- Remote images (Coil)
- MVVM/MVI with view models (Orbit MVI)
- Shared diagnostic logging (Napier)

It works reliably on both Android and iOS (other platforms are out of scope of this project)

You can use it as a template for kick-starting a new mobile app.
